## Overview
* Free Projects to learn Data Science in R for beginners
* Covers predictive modeling, data manipulation, data exploration, and machine learning algorithms in R

## Introduction
My first impression of R was that itâ€™s just a software for statistical computing. Good thing, I was wrong! R has enough provisions to implement machine learning algorithms in a fast and simple manner.

This is a complete project series to learn data science and machine learning using R. By the end of this hands-on, you will have a good exposure to building predictive models using machine learning on your own.
